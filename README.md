### Description

This software is for an advertising agency and basically it allows creation and storage of release orders and bills for them. It also has some reports which can be used for accounting and management purposes. This software is already being used by an advertising agency in my city. I think it can be modified and used by any advertising agency and publishing house for their business management. However keep in mind that you may need to change many things if you are from outside india.

I have used VB6 for coding, Crystal Reports 8.5 for Reports, MS-Access 2000 for Database. Since its a complete application, I think coders who are beginning to program can learn many things from it.

Something which can be learned are:

1. How to use access database over LAN, so that many clients use data from single access database.

2. How to save simple application settings in registry.

3. How to do validations.

4. How to connect to access database using ADO.

5. How to layout database forms. Look how I have used same 4 buttons (new, update, delete, exit) on all the data forms.

6. How to create professoinal reports using crystal reports.

Feel free to add what else you have learned from this code and how have this code helped you, if it really does.

I will be waiting for your comments, though I don't promise replying everybody as this is an old code and I don't remember much of it, so if you ask how and why something is written, I may not be able to answer that. And usually I am pretty stuck up with various activities in my small software firm, so don't have much time to read and reply every mail. I hope you will understand.

Happy Coding!!
